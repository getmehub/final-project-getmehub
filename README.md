#Final Project - Title "WITTY"

## Intro:
I would like to make app that is really simple but very useful and easy to use.
Lots of people in this world don't have much time to dig around the features and usefulness of an app.
Even the facebook users are declining as it is getting to complicated to use. So in today's world due
lack of time, people don't have much for fun.I would like to develop app which brings smiles in their face.
App users ranges from child to old grand parents and they are my product's target users.

##Three main feature of this app are:

-Very simple to use and no need for user login.

-Jokes can be listen as well.

-Shake the app device the it will change to next joke.


##App requirements(listed formally):

2 API,

Gesture detection,

Xkcd,

##App Use cases
User have choice of sending the jokes to friends.
